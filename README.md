# S.Y.T-TEAM-

## Client Story:
Every week our cohort in nazareth (Founders&Coders) start a Stop Go Continue (Link for details).
Every one willing to write a stop/go/con are asked to **stand up**, **walk** forward the white board , **find** a marker (sometimes **wait** for others to finish) and **write** his SGC, then **head back** to his sit.
after finishing the writing on the board , we are asked to vote on the SGC's by **raising hands**.
all of this are considered alot of physical work.
so we decided to build app that shortcut all of this physic work, save time and calories.
